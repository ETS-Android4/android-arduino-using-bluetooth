# Android-Arduino-Using-Bluetooth

This project is capable of transferring data in real time from an Arduino (microcontroller) to an Android Application.
This project was developed in Crucible of Research and Development(CoRI), PES University, Bangalore, in a Summer Internship program as a small part of another project.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
* Download the APK file from the project
* Install the APK file
* Upload the arduino code on the Arduino and make the required connections.
* Run the app, connect with the device by clicking on the Bluetooth Module of the Arduino in the list view and click on "start connection".
* Click on "Receive"
* You will now receive data from the arduino in real time

### Prerequisites

* This app has been developed on Android Studio and hence it is advisable to use **Android Studio**.
* An **Arduino IDE** is an essential requirement to upload the code onto the microcontroller

## Built With

* Android Studio - For the development of the Android App
* Arduino IDE - To work with the Microcontroller
